   <h2>Don't Even Want to Hear Your Cool Hacker Name</h2>

     <div class="card-body">
       <h4 class="card-title">Welcome to Meatspace</h4>
       <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Where everyone's life sucks?</h6>
       <p class="card-text">
         This isn’t your post-1980’s cyberpunk role playing game and it’s not the far future in “Just Another Shell Hacker.”
       </p>
   <p class="card-text">
         It’s not “Just Another Shell Hacker 2077” because this isn’t the far future we’re living in.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         It’s present day -- right the fuck now. You are just another disenfranchised-class, no-name, nothing-special-to-him-or-her, get-a-shell-or-die-trying hacker.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         And guess what? We’re in meatspace; you know what that’s like, really? I mean real deep into meatspace. You know how it’s different for us out here?</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         There’s no cloud virtualization reality server to go back to when the party’s over. You want to judge me from the neural net? I can’t even login to my own name.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         So let’s see how far you can get out of this corporate cesspool and back to verified status to operate in the confines of the corporate fucking rule of this planet -- where everything worth living for exists in geocentric orbit with trash, debris, and the view of Earth from up there behind so much cloudy dust and bullshit you can’t even really see how bad it is down there.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         Down here, motherfucker. Check your privilege -- you ain’t got none. This is where we live. This is how we live. This isn’t what you want to do. And this isn’t what you plan to do.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         Stick around, kid. You’re not going to find the typical cyberpunk classes roles to play here. You are a hacker. You’re just another one. We’re all hackers.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
         Let’s see what’s going to happen real quick if you’re not.</p>

               What’s your character’s name?</p>

               Oh, wait...</p>
   <p class="card-text">
               That’s a perk you don’t get at starting level. Let’s talk about your new email address.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
               Yeah, the new one. You think you’re just going to log back into a Virtico account down here? Shit. That’s a god damn laugh I needed.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
               Bitch, where you gonna make your email account at? Where you gonna type in the address to their node on what interface with what network? I don’t even want your cool hacker name, bitch.</p>
   <p class="card-text">
               You namesless, kid. Just Another Shell Hacker. Remember that.</p>
